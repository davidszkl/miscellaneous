# GameOfLife

Quick game of life emulator, pretty fun.
How to use:

make the project (available commands are: all, clean , re)
launch with command: 
./GameOfLife [sleeping_time] [random]

- if no arguments are specified, default sleep_time is set and random file generated
- if 1 argument is specified, argument sleep_time is set and random file generated
- if 2 arguments are specified, argument sleep_time is set and config file is read (no matter the second argument)

the config file must stay in a 100 by 40 characters format
you can use "." for dead cells and "@" for alive cells
you have to scale your terminal window to the right size...
